File Contents

This Excel file contains several sheets, each focusing on different aspects of mortgage rate analysis. Below is an explanation of each sheet:

1. Pivot Table

This sheet summarizes the average mortgage rates by year. It helps in understanding the long-term trend of mortgage rates over several decades.

2. EMI Calculation

This sheet contains calculations to estimate the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) based on various loan amounts and interest rates. It provides a detailed breakdown of the total principal, interest payments, and monthly payments.

3. Scenario Summary

This sheet presents different financial scenarios (Scenario A, B, and C) that compare different loan amounts and interest rates. The sheet allows users to assess how changes in loan terms affect payments and total interest paid over the loan term.

4. What-If Analysis

The what-if analysis is designed to help users evaluate the impact of refinancing or adjusting their mortgage. Users can modify loan amounts, interest rates, or loan durations to see how these changes affect their overall mortgage payments.

5. FRED Graph
